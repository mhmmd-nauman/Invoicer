    				<h3>1 The Dashboard</h3>
    				
    				<p>
						After logging into Innvoice, you will be take to your main dashboard. The dashboard page will give you a clear overview of the current state of affairs regarding your invoices, payments and clients.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<img src="img/screenshot1.png" alt="Innvoice">

						The three blocks at the top, indicate the amounts received, due and past due. The graph below shows total income for this year, distributed per month and compared to the previous year. The second graph shows the total income for this year distributed per client.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<b>Please note:</b> the dashboard can only display a single currency. If you have invoices in multiple currencies, you can use the currency drop down menu in the top right corner to switch between currencies.

					<h2>2 Invoices</h2>
					
					<p>
						Invoices is what it's all about with Innvoice. Innvoice allows you to create and manage Innvoice for multiple clients. Innvoice also supports multiple currencies (although a single invoice can only use one single currency).
					</p>
					
				</div><!-- /.#invoices -->
				
				<div class="section" id="invoice_create">
					
					<h2>2.1 Creating an Invoice</h2>
					
					<p>
						To create a new invoice, click the green button labeled "Create new invoice for ..." just next to the Innvoice logo in the top bar. This will reveal a list with your current clients; next you will need to select the client for which you'd like to generate the invoice. Once clicked, the new invoice will be generated and you will be redirected to the new invoice.

					<h2>2.2 Editing an Invoice</h2>
					
					<p>
						After opening up an invoice, you can either edit it in-line, or using the "Edit Invoice" button. When hovering over certain parts of the invoice, a blue dashed outline will appear around certain elements; this means this element can be editing in-line (try it by hovering over the invoice title). When you have made a change to an invoice, don't forget to click the save button (changes are not automatically saved!).
						
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<img src="img/screenshot3.png" alt="Innvoice">
					</p>
										
					<p>
						Another way to edit your invoice is to click the gray button labeled "Edit Invoice". This will reveal a panel showing the available options for your invoice. These options are divided into the following tabs:
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<img src="img/screenshot4.png" alt="Innvoice">
					</p>
					
					<h4>Invoice Details</h4>
					
					<p>
						This tab contains all the main options for your invoice.
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>

							This is the title as it appears on your invoice. This field can be left empty if you don't want a title displayed.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Client</b><br>
							The client to which this invoice is connected.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Invoice Number</b><br>
							Unique number identifying this invoice. This field is required for every invoice. When a new invoice is generated, this number is assigned automatically, using an internal counter. This internal counter can be reset/configured through the settings page.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>PO (Purchase Order) Number</b><br>
							The purchase order number for this invoice.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Issue Date</b><br>
							The date on which this invoice was issued. This field is a required field and is automatically set when the invoice is created (but can be changed later if needed).
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Visible to Client?</b><br>
							This determines whether the invoice can be publicly access on its own URL (so the client can view it online).
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Public URL</b><br>
							If the invoice is publicly visible; this field contains the URL on which the URL can be viewed. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Recurring Invoice</b><br>
							This setting will turn this invoice into a recurring one; meaning it will regenerate automatically until this setting is changed or the invoice is removed from the system.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Financials</h4>
					
					<p>
						This tab contains all the financial options for your invoice.
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Due Date</b><br>
							The date on which payment for this invoice is due.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Paid?</b><br>
							Is the status of this invoice set to "paid"? This overrides everything else, so whether payments have been made, the status of this invoice will be set to "paid" if "yes" is selected.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Currency</b><br>
							Which currency this invoice should use. When the invoice is created, the currency is automatically set according to the default currency for the client.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Discount</b><br>
							An optional discount in percentages.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Allow bank payment?</b><br>
							If set to "Yes", the client can submit a bank payment for this invoice.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Allow Credit Card payment?</b><br>
							If set to "Yes", the client is allowed to pay the invoice by credit card. Payments are handled by Stripe and for this setting to be available, the Stripe API keys need to have been entered.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Allow Paypal payment?</b><br>
							If set to "Yes", the client is allowed to pay the invoice by using Paypal. For this setting to be available, Paypal integration must have been configured.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Tax</h4>
					
					<p>
						This tab contains all the tax options for your invoice.
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Tax Type</b><br>
							This is the name of the tax as it appears on the invoice. Typically, this would be something like "VAT" or "GST". This field can contain any text value.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Tax %</b><br>
							The percentage of tax applied to this invoice. Please note that when a discount is applied in combination with a Tax, the discount is processed <b>before</b> the tax is deducted.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Notes</h4>
					
					<p>
						This tab contains all notes fields for this invoice.
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Top Note</b><br>
							This note appears at the top of the invoice, if any note is entered.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Bottom Note</b><br>
							This note appears at the bottom of the invoice, if any note is entered.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Internal Notes</b><br>
							This field is for internal notes only; the client will not be able to see this note.
						</li>
					</ul>
										
				</div><!-- /#invoice_edit -->
				
				<div class="section" id="invoice_items">
					
					<h2>2.3 Invoice Items</h2>
					
					<p>
						The item section is the table containing all your invoice items within your invoice. This section is fully customizable and you're free to structure this section any what you'd like. You can alter the structure of the table to meet your exact requirements. This flexibility makes Innvoice suitable for basically any type of business. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<img src="img/screenshot5.png" alt="Innvoice">
					</p>
					
					<p>
						To customize the item structure, either hover over the headers and click the green edit icon towards the right edge of the header OR click the gray button labeled "Edit Structure" below the items table. This will bring up a pop-up allowing you to modify the structure. Please note that when you modify the structure, the entire item section will reset, you will lose whatever data you currently have in the item section.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<img src="img/screenshot6.png" alt="Innvoice">
					</p>
					
					<p>
						When adding data to the item section, you can either add a single item by clicking the green button labeled "Add Single Item" OR you can click the green button labeled "Import Data" to import a CSV file.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Data Import</h4>
					
					<p>
						When using the Data Import function, please keep the following in mind:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							Make sure your "/tmp" folder is writable
						</li>
						<li>
							Your data file should contain <b>at least</b> three rows of data. If your file contains fewer data, the file import might not function properly
						</li>
						<li>
							Innvoice expects the first row in your file to contain the column names
						</li>
						<li>
							Innvoice expects the last column to contain numeric values only! (except for the header)
						</li>
						<li>
							When importing data, the entire item section is overwritten
						</li>
					</ul>
					
				</div><!-- /#invoice_items -->
				
				<div class="section" id="invoice_payments">
					
					<h2>2.4 Invoice Payments</h2>
					
					<p>
						Invoices would be of little usage without clients being able to pay 'em! Innvoice has got this covered by allowing clients to submit payments via bank, credit card and Paypal! The available payment methods are configured per invoice and depending on which methods are activated, the client will be able to use these to submit payments for their invoices.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<img src="img/screenshot7.png" alt="Innvoice">
					</p>
					
					<p>
						All payments made for a specific invoice will appear in the invoice's "Payments" section; to access this section, click the gray button labeled "Payments". In addition to having clients submit payments, payments can be entered by the administrator as well by clicking the green button labeled "Add Payment".
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The following payment types are available:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Bank</b><br>
							When your client chooses to submit a bank payment, he or she will be forced to upload a document when submitting the payment. Typically, this document would be a payment slip or screenshot proofing the bank transfer. This document will be accessible through the invoice's "Payments" section.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Stripe</b><br>
							Integration with Stripe will allow your clients to pay invoices with their credit cards. This option will only be available when Stripe integration has been configured. For more info regarding Stripe integration, please read the Payment Integration section of this manual.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Paypal</b><br>
							Integration with Paypal will allow your clients to pay invoices with their Paypal accounts (or their credit cards). This option will only be available when Paypal integration has been configured. For more info regarding Paypal integration, please read the Payment Integration section of this manual.

						After creating an invoice, ideally you'd like this invoice to be sent to your client.

The PDF version of the invoice will automatically be attached to the email.

                    <p>
                        Innvoice is fully translation ready, meaning all text such as labels, etc are stored in language files. The default language (English) files are stored in <b>/application/language/english/</b>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        To implement another language, German for example, you will need to start by copying all the files found in <b>/application/language/english/</b> to <b>/application/langauge/german/</b>. In addition, you will need to grab a copy of <b>/system/language/english/form_validation_lang.php</b> and place it in <b>/application/language/german/</b>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        You can now proceed to start translatng the langauge files. Most of the translation work should be done on the file named "innvoice_lang.php". The last step of this process is editing <b>/application/config/config.php</b> and change the language setting to "german".
                    </p>

					<h2>9 Cron</h2>
					
					<p>
						For the Innvoice application to function properly, certain tasks need to be performed automatically on a daily basis, this includes things like checking whether invoices are now past due and generating new invoices for a recurring invoice.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						For these tasks to run daily, the following URL should be called once every 24 hours: <b>http://yourdomain.com/index.php/cron/</b> (obviously you will need to change "yourdomain.com" to the correct domain name). If you have access to cpanel and your account has Cron Jobs activated (look under "Advanced > Cron Jobs"), you can add in a cron job to run once every 24 hours with one of the following commands:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>wget -qO- http://yourdomain.com/index.php/cron &> /dev/null</li>
						<li>/path/to/application/index.php cron</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						If you are not allowed to create cron jobs, you might want to use an external cron provider to ping the cron URL once every 24 hours. A quick Google search for "cron as a service" will reveal a number of options.

					<h2>Upgrading</h2>
					
					<p>
                        When upgrading your copy of Innvoice, the process typically involves two steps: updating the files AND updating the database.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        When updating the files, make sure you overwrite the following folders:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>

                    		/index.php
                    	</li>
                    	<li>
                    		/ci_3.x.x (make sure this corresponds with the <b>$system_path</b> variable in /index.php)
                    	</li>
                        <li>
                            /css
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            /js
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            /application/controllers
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            /application/helpers
                        </li>

                            /application/language/english
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            /application/libraries
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            /application/migrations
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            /application/models
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            /application/views
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        Next, you will need to update the database. Innvoice makes use of so called "migrations" to update the database. This way, you won't have to manually mess around with SQL. First, you will need to edit <b>/application/config/migration.php</b> and set "$config['migration_enabled']" to TRUE.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Now you will need to load the <b>migrate</b> controller in your browser by opening the following URL: <b>http://mywebsite.com/index.php/migrate</b>. Be sure to replace "http://mywebsite.com" with your site's actual URL (in addition, you might need to remove "index.php" if you have configured your site to use pretty URLs). You should now see a confirmation message saying your database is up to date.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        That's it, you're all up to date. If you experience any trouble while updating, please submit a ticket through <a href="http://selfhosted.net" target="_blank">http://selfhosted.net/support/</a> and we'll be more then happy to assist you!
